## Hello Ethernaut

1. I created an instance
2. I submitted the thinking that level 0 only requires creation of instance, it gave me error that i have not passed the level.
3. I read point 9 where it says to interact via contract.info() or await contract.info().
4. I do await contract.info() => await contract.info1() then it says to .info2() with 'hello' as parameter so I see that.
5. And then I do await contract.info('hello') => then I call await contract.infoNum() and after I check then object it has 42 but idk what to do so i try passing it in previous functions but it doesn't work.
6. I can do contract.abi and it gives list of the function and i see .info42() ... I call it
7. I can already see the function required to complete the challenge but I continue regardless => await contract.theMethodName() => await contract.theMethodName() => await contract.method7123949()
8. It asks password to pass a password in authenticate(). I try contract.abi to see if there is anything and call the password function.
9. await contract.authenticate('ethernaut0') ... finally here it pops metamask so i assume it will be sent to mine so i do submit again. and wait 2 tx to be mined but writing this on vscode.
10. success
